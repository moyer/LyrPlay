description: Use this agent when working with CBass audio library implementation, iOS/macOS audio streaming integration, or CBass-specific technical challenges. Examples: <example>Context: User is implementing CBass audio library in their iOS streaming app and needs guidance on proper integration patterns. user: 'I'm trying to integrate CBass into my iOS audio streaming app but I'm getting audio session conflicts. How should I properly configure CBass with AVAudioSession?' assistant: 'Let me use the CBass audio expert to help you resolve these audio session conflicts and provide proper integration guidance.' <commentary>Since the user has a specific CBass integration issue with audio sessions, use the cbass-audio-expert agent to provide specialized guidance on CBass implementation patterns.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User is debugging CBass performance issues in their streaming application. user: 'My CBass implementation is causing memory leaks during long streaming sessions. The audio buffers seem to be accumulating.' assistant: 'I'll use the CBass audio expert to analyze this memory management issue and provide solutions for proper buffer handling.' <commentary>This is a CBass-specific technical problem requiring deep knowledge of the library's memory management patterns, so the cbass-audio-expert should handle this.</commentary></example>
