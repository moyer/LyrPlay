# Privacy Policy for LyrPlay

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025

## Overview

LyrPlay is designed to respect your privacy. This privacy policy explains how the app handles information when you use LyrPlay to connect to your personal Lyrion Media Server (LMS).

## Information We Do Not Collect

LyrPlay does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information, including:
- Personal identification information
- Usage analytics or statistics
- Device information beyond what's required for local app functionality
- Location data
- Contact information
- Music listening habits or preferences

## Information Stored Locally

LyrPlay stores only the following information locally on your device using iOS UserDefaults:
- LMS server connection settings (IP address, ports)
- Player name and configuration preferences
- App settings and preferences

This information never leaves your device and is only used to connect to your own LMS server.

## Network Connections

LyrPlay connects only to:
- **Your LMS Server**: The app connects to the Lyrion Media Server address you configure
- **No External Services**: The app does not connect to any external APIs, analytics services, or third-party servers

All network communication is between your iOS device and your own LMS server on your local network or through your VPN connection.

## Third-Party Services

LyrPlay does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Security

Since LyrPlay does not collect or transmit personal data, there are no data security concerns beyond the standard iOS app security model. All app preferences are stored locally using iOS standard UserDefaults.

## Children's Privacy

LyrPlay does not collect any information from users of any age. The app is safe for use by children as it operates entirely with user-owned infrastructure.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document in the LyrPlay GitHub repository.
