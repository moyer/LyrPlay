## FLAC Setup

For optimal FLAC seeking, add this rule to your LMS server's `convert.conf` file BEFORE existing FLAC rules:

```
flc flc * [YOUR_DEVICE_MAC_ADDRESS]
    # IFT:{START=--skip=%t}U:{END=--until=%v}D:{RESAMPLE=-r %d}
    [flac] -dcs $START$ $END$ --force-raw-format --sign=signed --endian=little -- $FILE$ | [sox] -q -t raw --encoding signed-integer -b $SAMPLESIZE$ -r $SAMPLERATE$ -c $CHANNELS$ -L - -t flac -r 44100 -C 0 -b 16 -
```

Replace `[YOUR_DEVICE_MAC_ADDRESS]` with your device's MAC address shown in LMS web interface.
